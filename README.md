# real-estate-research
## Description
People are on the move in the US more than ever. With the unprecedented amount of recent fires across the nation, particularly in the Western United States, Air Quality information has become a vitally important factor in home-buyers decision to relocate their families. This information, along with average work commute times are two important pieces of information which are missing from online real estate marketplaces such as zillow & many others.
Our app will provide a simple search by zip code form which will return the average commute time and the AQI for that county. We will utilize the server-side api from airnow.gov and the census bureau to pull the data.
Home Buyers can use this tool to instantly learn the Air Quality Index and Average Commute to Work (in minutes) for any zip code in the United States.
- What was your motivation?
  The motivation behind this project was to give home buyers important information on local air quality & the average work commute time associated with their potential new city's zip code.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  We built this project because the biggest online real estate marketplaces do not provide a city's AQI(Air Quality Index) or it's average work commute time. With the increase in wildfires across the United States, particularly the Western United States, knowing the Air Quality & its safety is an important factor in moving somewhere new. The average commute time for someone traveling to work can also play a critical role in a home movers decision process.
- What problem does it solve?
  This app solves the problem of users not having an all-in-one website location to view important geographic information such as AQI, commute time, ect. Previously users would need to find this information from seperate websites which can be unneccesarily difficult & frustrating.
- What did you learn?
  We learned how to fetch & combine multiple API information to provide our users with an easy to use zip code search function. We also learned how to use new CSS frameworks outside our current knowledge base.
  We learned how to use new CSS frameworks such as Materialize CSS.
  
## Table of Contents (Optional)
-If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

## Installation
-What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
-Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
`md ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png) `
This application provides a simple search box which allows users to pull information from specific county's using a zip code.
Once the zip code is entered, the user will see a list of information including the targeted county's AQI number(1, 2, 3..), its category desciption(Good, Moderate, Unhealthy..), as well as its average work commute time(20 min..).
